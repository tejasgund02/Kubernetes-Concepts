# Kubernetes Key Concepts

## 1. Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster.

## 2. Nodes
Nodes are worker machines in a Kubernetes cluster where Pods are deployed and executed.

## 3. Namespaces
Namespaces provide a way to logically divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters.

## 4. Deployments
Deployments manage and automate the scaling and updating of Pods to ensure high availability.

## 5. Services
Services define a stable endpoint to expose and balance traffic between Pods, ensuring seamless communication.

## 6. ConfigMaps
ConfigMaps store configuration data that can be used by Pods without modifying container images.

## 7. Secrets
Secrets securely store sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and tokens for Pods to use.

## 8. Ingress
Ingress manages external access to services, typically HTTP/S, using rules and load balancing.

## 9. Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
PV provides storage resources in a cluster, while PVCs allow Pods to request specific storage dynamically.

## 10. StatefulSets
StatefulSets manage stateful applications, ensuring Pods maintain identity and data consistency.

## 11. DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a specific Pod runs on all or some Nodes in a cluster.

## 12. Jobs & CronJobs
Jobs run tasks to completion, while CronJobs schedule tasks to run periodically.

## 13. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
RBAC controls access to resources in a Kubernetes cluster by defining roles and permissions.

## 14. Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment using charts.
