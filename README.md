# Kubernetes Concepts

This repository covers fundamental **Kubernetes concepts**, essential for container orchestration, scaling, and managing cloud-native applications. Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of nodes.

## Key Kubernetes Concepts

### 1. Pods  
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share storage and networking.

### 2. Nodes  
Nodes are the worker machines in a Kubernetes cluster where Pods are scheduled and run. They can be physical or virtual machines.

### 3. Cluster  
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane (managing the cluster) and worker nodes (running applications), ensuring high availability and scalability.

### 4. Deployments  
Deployments define how applications are managed, updated, and scaled in Kubernetes. They ensure high availability and rollback capabilities.

### 5. Services  
Services provide stable networking and load balancing for Pods, enabling communication between components inside and outside the cluster.

### 6. ConfigMaps and Secrets  
ConfigMaps store non-sensitive configuration data, while Secrets handle sensitive information like API keys and passwords securely.

### 7. Namespaces  
Namespaces provide logical separation within a cluster, allowing multiple teams or applications to coexist without conflicts.

### 8. Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)  
PV and PVC handle persistent storage in Kubernetes, ensuring data remains available even if Pods are restarted.

### 9. Ingress  
Ingress manages external access to services using HTTP/HTTPS, providing routing, load balancing, and SSL termination.

### 10. Helm  
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment using pre-configured templates called Helm charts.
